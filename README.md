# Bowser: The Daemon Browser

Bowser is the least amount of web browser I can get away with. The guiding philosophy is that it delegates as much of it's UI to the host window manager as possible and is primarily controlled through it's CLI, acting as a daemon service. For example it has no tab interface and no URL bar, instead you should probably have a good tiling window manager, and then a way to invoke the open command from said window manager.

It is only suggested for use in tiling window managers with easily customized launchers. And even then only for users who are a bit deranged.
